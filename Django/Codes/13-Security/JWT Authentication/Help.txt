=> documentation for djangorestframework-simplejwt library
   https://pypi.org/project/djangorestframework-simplejwt/

=> Add following lines of code into project's settings.py
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
        'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
            'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
        ],
    }

=> to get new access token add the following in the body
    {
        "refresh": "refresh_token_here"
    }

=> If access token expires then we need to get new access token using refresh token api (api/token/refresh) which
   requires the refresh token.

=> We can only generate new access token using refresh token which user gets on signup

=> If we generate new access token using refresh token api while old access token is not expired then claim of old access token
   expires which means we cannot use it further. Only new access token can be used

=> if refresh token expires then we cannot generate new access token because we need it to generate new access
   token. In that case we have to generate new access token and new refresh token using access token api
   (api/token) but it needs user authentication

=> It is recommended that access token expiration time is unlimited (lets say 10 years) so that user does not need to
   generate token again and again

=> to change token expiration time settings add the following code into project's settings.py
    SIMPLE_JWT = {
    'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=5),  # default expiration time for access token
    'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=1)  # default expiration time for refresh token
}
