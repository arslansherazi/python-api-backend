=>While writing a path for a view of a particular application(Coding) under urls.py(Coding/urls.py) add "/" at the end otherwise
if user enters / at the end of requested url then 404 error will be generated but if "/" is present at the end of path then
requested url will be working for both cases whether user enters / at the end of requested url or not
  Example::
  path('page1/', views.page1, name='page1')

  Now "localhost:8000/page1" and "localhost:8000/page1/" both will be working fine

=>For accessing view/page requested url must use path. name of path is only used for specifying links within html pages for
  that particular view/page and both can be changed
  Example::
  path('page1/', views.page1, name='page1_link')

=>For understanding routes see "urls.py" under "Routes" folder.
