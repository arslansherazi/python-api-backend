=>By default, access tokens have 15 minutes lifetime while refresh tokens have 30 days lifetime
=>we cannot access jwt_required endpoints using refresh token and jwt_refresh_token_required endpoints using
  access token.
=> If access token expires then we need to get new access token using refresh token api (api/token/refresh) which
   requires the refresh token.

=> We can only generate new access token using refresh token which user gets on signup

=> If we generate new access token using refresh token api while old access token is not expired then claim of old access token
   expires which means we cannot use it further. Only new access token can be used

=> if refresh token expires then we cannot generate new access token because we need it to generate new access
   token. In that case we have to generate new access token and new refresh token but it required authentication

=> It is recommended that access token expiration time is unlimited (lets say 10 years) so that user does not need to
   generate token again and again
